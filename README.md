### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Jaswinder.  I am based out of nowhere and I like it that way. I studied Computer Science during my Undergrad and have been working since 2018. 

I started my journey with working a traditional financial institutions building Payment engines for UK and EU. 

After seeing the traditional finance from inside, I came to a rather obvious conclusion. Open, decentralised systems are the future. Future of money, governance and most importantly the Internet. 

After leaving my first job, I have worked on multiple Projects on Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon and Near. From the last one year, I have been dedicated to only Near. 

Building dApps, libraries, Infrastructure. Contributing to nearcore, smart contract sdks and api libraries. 

I also co-founder a developer collective of Open Source enthusiast at harmonicguild.io solving the most exciting problems in Web3.
